	Completing the previous steps enables you to download and install Jenkins on AWS. To download and install Jenkins:
		1. Ensure that your software packages are up to date on your instance by using the following command to perform a quick software update:
[ec2-user ~]$ sudo yum update –y
		2. Add the Jenkins repo using the following command:
[ec2-user ~]$ sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo \
    https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
		3. Import a key file from Jenkins-CI to enable installation from the package:
[ec2-user ~]$ sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
[ec2-user ~]$ sudo yum upgrade
		4. Install Java (Amazon Linux 2023):
[ec2-user ~]$ sudo dnf install java-17-amazon-corretto -y
		5. Install Jenkins:
[ec2-user ~]$ sudo yum install jenkins -y
		6. Enable the Jenkins service to start at boot:
[ec2-user ~]$ sudo systemctl enable jenkins
		7. Start Jenkins as a service:
[ec2-user ~]$ sudo systemctl start jenkins
	You can check the status of the Jenkins service using the command:
	[ec2-user ~]$ sudo systemctl status jenkins
	Configuring Jenkins
	Jenkins is now installed and running on your EC2 instance. To configure Jenkins:
		1. Connect to http://<your_server_public_DNS>:8080 from your browser. You will be able to access Jenkins through its management interface:
		
		2. As prompted, enter the password found in /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword.
			a. Use the following command to display this password:
[ec2-user ~]$ sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
		3. The Jenkins installation script directs you to the Customize Jenkins page. Click Install suggested plugins.
		4. Once the installation is complete, the Create First Admin User will open. Enter your information, and then select Save and Continue.
		
		5. On the left-hand side, select Manage Jenkins, and then select Manage Plugins.
		6. Select the Available tab, and then enter Amazon EC2 plugin at the top right.
		7. Select the checkbox next to Amazon EC2 plugin, and then select Install without restart.
		
		8. Once the installation is done, select Back to Dashboard.
		9. Select Configure a cloud if there are no existing nodes or clouds.
		
		10. If you already have other nodes or clouds set up, select Manage Jenkins.
		
			a. After navigating to Manage Jenkins, select Configure Nodes and Clouds from the left hand side of the page.
			
			b. From here, select Clouds.
			
		11. Select Add a new cloud, and select Amazon EC2. A collection of new fields appears.
		
		12. Click Add under Amazon EC2 Credentials
		
			a. From the Jenkins Credentials Provider, select AWS Credentials as the Kind.
			
			b. Scroll down and enter in the IAM User programmatic access keys with permissions to launch EC2 instances and select Add.
			
			c. Scroll down to select your region using the drop-down, and select Add for the EC2 Key Pair’s Private Key.
			
			d. From the Jenkins Credentials Provider, select SSH Username with private key as the Kind and set the Username to ec2-user.
			
			e. Scroll down and select Enter Directly under Private Key, then select Add.
			
			f. Open the private key pair you created in the creating a key pair step and paste in the contents from "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----" to "-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----". Select Add when completed.
			
			g. Scroll down to "Test Connection" and ensure it states "Success". Select Save when done
			
	You are now ready to use EC2 instances as Jenkins agents.
	Cleaning up
	After completing this tutorial, be sure to delete the AWS resources that you created so you do not continue to accrue charges.
	Deleting your EC2 instance
		1. In the left-hand navigation bar of the Amazon EC2 console, select Instances.
		2. Right-click on the instance you created earlier, and select Terminate.
